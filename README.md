# About me

My name is Eissa Soubhi, I'm a 27 years old full stack PHP developer with 5 years of experience from Casablanca, the kingdom of Morocco.


## The Backend

On my projects, I've worked with many programming languages for the backend like ASP.NET, JEE and PHP but I chose to stick with PHP because I liked how it allows me to know and control what happens under the hood, but that comes with some security and performance costs so working with a Framework is a must.
Unlike choosing a backend language, when I first worked with Laravel 4 years ago, I just fell in love with it instantly.

## The Frontend

I've worked with Vue.js, Angular and React each one of those Frameworks has its pros and cons but I liked them all and I dont mind to work with anyone of them.
Let's not forget about CSS, there is so much to tell about this language but let me conclud it by saying I mostly work with Sass and the widly popular CSS framework Bootstrap.

## IDEs and Text editors

Now let's talk about IDEs and Text editors, most PHP developers say PhpStome is the best IDE for PHP and it has a lot of features, I've tried it but I prefer to keep things lightweight and simple, I think you know what I'm talking about... yes exactly it's Sublime Text... Sublime Text is and always will be my prefered code editor, I dont undersand why dont they just make it the default text editor in all OSes, you ask me why? here is my answer on Quora https://www.quora.com/Which-IDE-or-text-editor-are-you-using-right-now-Why/answer/Eissa-Soubhi

## My projects

Programming skills are like muscles, if we stop training them. soon, they will be weak/forgotten, in this case side projects are the best training to keep up with the new technologies and enhance my programming skills. and if possible, also contribute to the opensouce community.
